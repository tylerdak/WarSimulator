# War Simulator
### by Tyler Dakin

  

## Overview

War Simulator is designed to simulate the card game, War, but on a much larger scale. A user can decide to run several games with several players and get the outcomes printed back to them. 

## Dependencies
This program uses packages **sys** and **random** but both should be included with your installation of Python. If I recall correctly, I did not need to use pip to install them.

##### As of writing this I do not have plans to do a full write-up on this program.
